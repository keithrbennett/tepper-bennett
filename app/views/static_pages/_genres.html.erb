<h3>The Many Genres</h3>
<p>
  Sid and Roy’s discography ran the gamut of genres, and were sung by a vast constellation of stars. They were equally
  at home with love songs, children’s songs, and just plain fun songs. With over 300 published songs, the duo covered
  many genres, but regardless of type, their songs, as The New York Times put it, were distinguished by a wholly
  enjoyable combination of catchy melody and clever lyrics.

<h4>Love Songs</h4>


<p>
  Sid and Roy often wrote about love, and came up with a number of memorable songs that approached it from a variety of
  angles. Among those that still resonate deeply with audiences are

<h4>Movie Songs</h4>

<p>
  Each time an Elvis movie was in the works, the Colonel would send the screenplay to their trusted songwriting teams,
  who’d then submit their work for consideration. Some 42 songs by the pair made their way into the films, more than for
  any other team. There were beautiful ballads and smart, amusing songs, each crafted for a particular scene. The
  Presley estate recognized the importance of the duo to Elvis’ career, with both a lifetime achievement award and with
  the Elvis Fans Choice Award for Best Movie Soundtrack for their five songs in the movie “Blue Hawaii”.
